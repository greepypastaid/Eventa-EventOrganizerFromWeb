# Project Improvements

## 1. Dependency Management
- Fixed React version conflicts by standardizing on React 18.2.0
- Removed duplicate dependencies in package.json
- Ensured consistent dependency versions

## 2. Code Organization
- Created a better component structure:
  - `Navigation/` directory for navigation-related components
  - `UI/` directory for reusable UI components
- Broke down large components into smaller, more manageable ones:
  - Split `MainNavbar.jsx` (339 lines) into multiple components:
    - `NavigationLink.jsx`
    - `AdminMenu.jsx`
    - `AuthButtons.jsx`
    - `MobileMenu.jsx`
  - Created unified UI components:
    - `Button.jsx` with primary, secondary, and danger variants
    - `Input.jsx` combining TextInput, InputLabel, InputError, and Textarea

## 3. Code Quality Tools
- Added ESLint for JavaScript/React code linting
- Added Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Created configuration files:
  - `.eslintrc.json`
  - `.prettierrc`
  - `.prettierignore`
- Added npm scripts for linting and formatting:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run lint:fix`
  - `npm run format`

## 4. Import Management
- Updated import paths to use the new component structure
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping original files as backups

## Next Steps
- Run ESLint and Prettier on the entire codebase
- Further refactor large components
- Add unit tests for components
- Improve documentation for components
